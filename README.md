## Overview

Wildfires pose a significant threat to ecosystems and communities worldwide. Our Real-Time Forest Fire Detection project endeavors to revolutionize how we detect and respond to these threats, leveraging advanced technologies and data-driven approaches.

### Project Goals

- Develop a sophisticated real-time forest fire detection algorithm.
- Address limitations present in current detection systems.
- Contribute to the prevention and control of forest fires globally.

### Why Real-Time Detection Matters?

Early detection is crucial in mitigating the impact of forest fires. Our project focuses on leveraging high-resolution imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide timely and accurate information for swift intervention.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Detection:** Utilizing the YOLOv8 model for fast and accurate object detection.
- **Feature Engineering:** Incorporating smoke detection, wind direction analysis, and fire location prediction.
- **Dataset:** High-resolution images obtained from TB-2 UAVs operated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
- **Exploratory Data Analytics:** In-depth analysis of forest fire causes based on academic publications and expert insights.

## Objectives

1. **Algorithm Development:**
   - Develop an algorithm capable of real-time forest fire detection.
   - Utilize cutting-edge technology, including the YOLOv8 model, for efficient and accurate object detection.

2. **System Enhancement:**
   - Address limitations in current forest fire detection systems, including coverage gaps and delayed notifications.
   - Strive for a system that is cost-effective, scalable, and adaptable to diverse environments.

3. **Contribution to Prevention:**
   - Contribute insights and technology to the global effort in preventing and controlling forest fires.
   - Promote sustainable environmental practices through the early detection and intervention.

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Alignment

- **SDG 13: Climate Action:**
  - Mitigating the impact of forest fires to reduce carbon emissions.
  - Enhancing the adaptability of communities and ecosystems to climate-related disasters.

- **SDG 15: Life on Land:**
  - Protecting terrestrial ecosystems through effective forest fire prevention.
  - Safeguarding biodiversity and ensuring sustainable land management practices.
